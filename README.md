#Description: This was a the last challenge of the Kevin-Powel responsive web design course.
I could design it more responsive and also responsive for small devices like iphone-6 but the code require the code conditions and as the challenge said we have two
breakpoints at 1000px and 700px.

If you are learning the the HTML and css and you have problem with responsive web-design I recommand you this course by Kevin-Powel , which is really come in handy.
